Andrej Karpathy gave a talk at the Pytorch Developer Conference on "Software 2.0" a term he has been using recently to describe a new programming paradigm where the programming is done by machine learning.  I remember previously, seeing or reading, something by Andrej about Software 2.0 where he described its thesis, so I was already familiar with the idea and its merit.  This new talk, however, was a sort of engineering best pratices talk including: TDD, CI, and version control equivalents in Software 2.0.  The talk was rather short only 10 minutes so he couldn't cover a lot; but it raised a question for me which I think is a reasonable one and somewhat an implicit conclusion of his talk. Namely, is randomization considered harmful?
